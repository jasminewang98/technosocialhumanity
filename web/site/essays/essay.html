				Self development and technological infrastructure are becoming increasingly interconnected with the advent of ubiquitous computing. Yet the digital world consists not only of this new technological infrastructure, but also the human agents interacting within. The evaluation of its impact on our own essential humanity should be parcelled by user groupings, namely individual, government, and corporate bodies. It is critical for humanists to redefine and preserve humanity with the rapid technological rewiring of society’s topology. 

			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				Individual-inflicted effects of digital use on the self are perhaps the most obvious. “Technologies actively shape our notion of the self … they define the structure and tempo of our self-experimentation”<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note10">&#8224;</span>.  Typewritten, technologically broadcast personal narratives foster a sort of self-formation that is much different from that which occurs when writing in a personal journal. Even confessional journalism, like Rousseau’s Confessions or Sylvia Plath’s poetry, have a much different effect on the self than personal statuses on digital platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The brief, simplified, and regular posts that digital platforms favour lead to constant feedback and regulation on this ‘self-writing’. Although writing does allow one to understand one’s unique experiences and narratives, and thus enhances one’s essential humanity, the constant public audience of this newly digital self-writing can have normative, inhibiting effects on one’s self development. If one’s essential humanity is supposed to be individualized and stable, the near absurd rate of self-writing and self-transformation offered by digital platforms unquestionably erodes personal narrativity. However, it is interesting and important to note that new theories have emerged about self-concept; recent psychology studies have revealed that one’s personality traits at age seventy  have no correlation to those traits possessed at age seventeen<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note1">&#8224;</span>, and postmodern theories of self posit that the self is unstable and contingent	<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note2">&#8224;</span>. This constant ‘networking’ of the self has been said by some theorists to have some merit; Hayles states that “for some people, including me, the posthuman evokes the exhilarating prospect of getting out of some of the old boxes and opening up new ways of thinking about what being human means” <span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note3">&#8224;</span>. However, even if the self is constantly in flux, the process of self-reflection and intrapersonal negotiation becomes increasingly important to self-formation and understanding.
			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				Digital technology allows the public a rate of self-acceleration and amplification once restricted to the elite. According to Kirby’s theory of digimodernism, digital technologies allow the public to become artist as well as viewer<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note11">&#8224;</span>. Individuals can form digital mentorship groups around niche personal interests, and they can take free Massively Open Online Courses to accelerate their learning. Everyone can become a subject expert, and then express and share their expertise on personalized digital platforms like blogs. In short, technology has been an incredible equalizer. Increased access to education and developmental resources are largely a boon for our collective humanity. This knowledge acquisition comes at a price, however. Platforms modify and transform the information they display; the medium, in this case the technological infrastructure, is truly the message. Technology hides political bias and agenda from public view, while allowing the manipulated highlighting of certain informational bites and shadowing of others<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note13">&#8224;</span>. Information is valuated and disseminated according to its rate of consumption instead of for its merit and truth; especially with the death of expertise, this has allowed for the proliferation of ‘fake news’. 

			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				While impact on essential humanity through personal use of digital technologies is complex and nuanced, corporate usage is clearly degrading. Fundamentally, corporations still design for consumers instead of for humans and human systems; it is not within corporate monetization strategies to look beyond the initial consumptive act. The Silicon Valley bubble also often designs for shallow problems, such as pet-grooming services, or problems that do not truly exist. It is even ingrained into their ethos to ‘design for problems customers are unaware they had’. Even if corporations shifted to focus on heavier problems, differentiation of problems still has to be nuanced. To what extent should we remove friction and difficulty from the human experience, and at what cost? What parts of our lives now are essential to the human experience, and what parts should be improved? “Silicon Valley’s great ameliorative experiment”<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note4">&#8224;</span> can be a great boon if and only if these questions are answered thoroughly. However, their answers are complicated by the newfound rate of self-development and increased self-relativity fostered by the same technological acceleration. 
			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				More directly harmful is the corporate collection, mining, and analyzing of techno-social interactions. The separation of information and body as described by Hayles can be most clearly seen today in the corporate extraction of data. Human beings are reduced to users; interests becomes digitalized, commercialized, and interpreted as mere data points. Corporate collection of data is problematic for our own essential humanity for several reasons. 

			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				Firstly, recommendation algorithms create ideological bubbles within which users are not exposed to other viewpoints, and only reinforced by their own beliefs. Recommendation algorithms foster unquestioned ideological bubbles; individuals “have become used to the idea that information can appear effortlessly in our browsers” <span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note12">&#8224;</span> . Algorithmic media has serious implications for self development; ideological discomfort is challenging but necessary for healthy minds and healthy societies. This unbalanced informational diet is also a result of the laziness that digital platforms bring; aggregated social platforms like Facebook combine so many functionalities that they are both easily made unique and universal. Secondly, algorithms corporations train on human-generated data can propose causal relationships between data points that are problematic and discriminatory. A 2016 White House report on big data and its applications warns against data fundamentalism, “the belief that numbers cannot lie and always represent objective truth”		
				<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note5">&#8224;</span>.  When decision-makers assume that correlation implies causation, algorithmic decisions can appear to suggest that historically disadvantaged groups actually deserve less favorable treatment as a result of the historical biases against them	<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note6">&#8224;</span>. Data, and implicitly technology, is socially positioned as neutral. Yet, data sets can be biased, as well as their analysis. As big data and machine learning research and development accelerate beyond current ethical maps, we must question the Silicon Valley treatment of innovation and progress as inherently good. Thirdly, big data systems create an asymmetry of knowledge and power between those who use the data and those who provide it . Often, algorithmic biases are implicit, and algorithmic processes protected for proprietary reasons. Thus, it is difficult to pinpoint, correct, and advocate against algorithmic biases. Individuals must have legal rights against algorithmic decisions, at minimum, new methodologies must be developed to reduce discrimination and bias in algorithms. 

			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				In certain situations, such as in recommendation algorithms on social media, having too restrictive an algorithm is detrimental to personal development. It is essential to remember algorithms can be biased, either because they have been trained on biased input data or they are not content-neutral; thus, we must be especially careful when employing algorithms towards social problems or social ends.

			
			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				Lastly, we must evaluate the effects of technology when wielded by those with a political agenda, the most overt of whom are governmental bodies. In recent years, there has been a movement to tackle civic apathy through gamification. Civic gamification uses badges, points, even money to incentivize behaviour, and build on “the capacity of connected digital platforms to support interactivity and feedback”<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note7">&#8224;</span>. Morozov’s critique of gamification is ideological; he believes that gamified actions are not as ‘true’ as self-initiated ones<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note4">&#8224;</span>. There are further arguments on psychological basis that gamification is degrading; for example, the replacement of intrinsic motivation with extrinsic motivation in an area as sensitive to the human self as politics is problematic. MC2, a civic gamification platform built on machine learning algorithms, is secretly set to launch in Ottawa in July in celebration of Canada’s sesquicentennial; its resulting planned rollout across Canada is our nation’s first systematic attempt at gamifying our politics, with potentially huge implications. “Games are the most powerful source of non-coercive influence in the world, and are frequently designed with mild addiction .. in mind”<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note8">&#8224;</span>; we must pay close attention to how and why gamification is being implemented. By over-incentivizing political engagement, such technology would remove internal motivation, morality, ethics, and reasoning in something as fundamental to humanity as politics. Darwin believed the the main differentiator between humankind and animals was “moral sense or conscience”; modern scientists propose that the capacity for ethics is a “necessary attribute of human nature”<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note9">&#8224;</span>. 
			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				More sinister is the potential of government data usage for social control. The ability to monitor all citizens at all times is easily conceivable within today’s technological constraints. Morozov states that “imperfection .. the opportunity to err, to sin, to do the wrong thing: all of these are constitutive of human freedom”<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note4">&#8224;</span>.  The external regulation that individuals willingly submit themselves to on social platforms  becomes truly dangerous when forcibly enforced by powerful bodies with political intent. Although this extent of government monitoring has not been implemented in the Western world, at least to public knowledge, events like the FBI’s argument with Apple in the US about their right to private information raises serious concerns, as does Queen Elizabeth II’s signing of the “Investigatory Powers Act” in the UK. New capacities of surveillance poses an especial risk to activists who work against such political bodies, and a risk for all those who are in some way deviant. Traditional normative forces could be strengthened inconceivably with surveillance technologies.
			</p>

			<p class="bodyPara">
				Certain elements of humanity are lost and amplified through technology, and some theorists argue that now humanity is defined recursively and relationally to our environment: a sort of reflexive epistemology. Even if we do accept this new ambiguity of self definition,  it is crucial to dispel the myth of data and technological fundamentalism and to critically analyze the impacts of digital tools on our collective humanity as our technosocial society becomes increasingly algorithmic and analytic. As human experience become more frictionless, it is critical to investigate the inner workings of black boxes and walled gardens, and ensure that they do not accelerate the disparity between those with power and those without. Perhaps it is true that the posthuman need not be antihuman<span class="trigger" data-popupNote="#note3">&#8224;</span>, yet it is up to the public, perhaps especially digitally-literate students of the humanities, to advocate for the preservation of our own essential humanity in this digitally disrupted world. The values we build, or fail to preserve, will define our society for decades to come. It has never been more pressing to firmly investigate and define what it means to be human than in our digitally accelerated world of constant progress.
